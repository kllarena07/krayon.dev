# On Advice

_Searching for signal._  
I'm just gonna keep this one short and simple.

Advice can be extremely powerful but there is A LOT of it out there and some of it may not even be applicable to you! So, here are some guidelines.

If you get advice from someone and either:

1. They are in a position you do not want to be in
2. You can't walk away with anything actionable

That advice that you have received is **shit** (this is nuanced). Either ask for clarification or do not listen to the person giving the advice.

That’s all.
